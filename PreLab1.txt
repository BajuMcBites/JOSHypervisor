1. What does the cpuid assembly instruction do in this function?

depending on the input argument "info", cpuid will return various information about the processor. 
The information is stored in the eax, ebx, ecx, edx registers.

"info" is passed into eax which will determine the outputs of cpuid.

2. How is the function providing values back to you to use?

we can access the values through the pointers passed in the function argument.
After the asm instruction the pointers point to the output of the cpuid instruction (if there was an output)


It provides values through the values stored in the eax, ebx, ecx, and edx
registers. Which (ebx, ecx, and edx) can each be interpreted as strings and
piced together to get the manufacturer's string ID.

3. What are the results of eax, ecx, and ebx values in hexadecimal? Hint: you 
can print program variables from GDBLinks to an external site.

eax = 0xd
ebx = 0x756e6547
ecx = 0x6c65746e

4. Now examine the values of these variables as strings. Hint: look at the 
values in hexadecimal and translate them to strings, in the order ebx, edx, 
ecx. What do you observe? The Wikipedia pageLinks to an external site. for the 
`cpuid` instruction may help you interpret this output.

eax = 'ctrl'

ebx = uneG

ecx = letn

edx = Ieni

"GenuineIntel"

5. There is a reference in each Env struct for another struct called
VmxGuestInfo. What kind of information does this struct hold?


```
struct VmxGuestInfo {
	int64_t phys_sz;
	uintptr_t *vmcs;

	// Exception bitmap.
	uint32_t exception_bmap;
	// I/O bitmap.
	uint64_t *io_bmap_a;
	uint64_t *io_bmap_b;
	// MSR load/store area.
	int msr_count;
	uintptr_t *msr_host_area;
	uintptr_t *msr_guest_area;
	int vcpunum;
};
```

it holds the size of the vm, a pointer to the vm control structure, some bitmaps,
and other info.

6. From this Intel guideLinks to an external site., find out what the vmcs
pointer in this struct stands for, and what it purpose it serves.

VIRTUAL-MACHINE CONTROL STRUCTURE

VMX non-root operation and VMX transitions

7. What assembly instruction initializes the vmcs pointer? In other words, how
do we change the vmcs pointer?

vmptrld is used to change the vmcs pointer.
